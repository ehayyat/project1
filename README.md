## Looking at the relationship between Solar Power Usage and Country's GDP
### by: Tony Garcia, Elza Hayyat, Sammy Mohn, Kim Trejo

**Datasets Used:**
1. Kaggle: Solar Power by Country (https://www.kaggle.com/prasertk/solar-power-by-country)
2. The World Bank: GDP by Country (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD)



**Questions Addressed:**
1. How does solar power usage compare from 2016 to 2020 across all countries?
2. Does a country with higher GDP exhibit more solar power usage than a country with lower GDP?
3. When looking at specific countries based on highest or lowest average GDP, what is the solar power usage trend that is observed?
